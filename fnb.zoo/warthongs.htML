                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>Warthogs</p>
- <p>Speed: Warthogs can run surprisingly fast, reaching speeds of up to 45 km/h (28 mph) while navigating challenging terrain.
- Habitat: They live in the African savanna, where they can be found in grasslands and open woodlands.
- Behavior: Female warthogs are devoted mothers, defending their young against threats using their powerful snouts and sharp tusks.
- Types: There are two main types of warthogs: the common warthog and the desert warthog, which can travel at 55 km/h (34 mph) over short distances.
  Here's a comprehensive overview of warthogs:</p>

<p>Physical Characteristics
- Body: Warthogs have a sturdy body, with a distinctive set of facial "warts" or thick skin growths.
- Tusks: They have sharp, curved tusks that are used for defense, digging, and fighting.
- Size: Warthogs typically weigh between 40-90 kg (88-198 lbs) and reach 1-1.5 meters (3.3-4.9 feet) in length, including their tail.
- Coat: Their coat is usually coarse and bristly, with a grayish-brown color.</p>

<p>Habitat and Distribution
- Savannas and Grasslands: Warthogs inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands in Africa.
- Range: They can be found in various countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique.</p>

<p>Diet and Nutrition
- Omnivores: Warthogs are omnivores, feeding on grasses, roots, fruits, and insects.
- Digging: They use their tusks and snouts to dig for roots and tubers.</p>

<p>Behavior and Social Structure
- Social Animals: Warthogs often live in small groups, called "sounders," which usually consist of females and their young.
- Male Groups: Males may form bachelor groups or wander on their own.
- Communication: Warthogs communicate through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and scent marking.</p>

<p>Reproduction and Lifespan
- Gestation Period: Female warthogs have a gestation period of about 170-175 days.
- Litter Size: They typically give birth to 2-4 piglets, which are born with their eyes open and can run within hours of birth.
- Lifespan: Warthogs can live up to 15-20 years in the wild, although their average lifespan is around 10-15 years due to predation and other threats.</p>

<p>Interesting Facts
- Wart-like Growths: The facial "warts" on warthogs are actually thick skin growths that help protect their faces during fights.
- Digging Ability: Warthogs are skilled diggers, using their tusks and snouts to excavate burrows and find food.</p>


Conservation Status
- Least Concern: Warthogs are listed as "least concern" on the IUCN Red List, although their populations are declining in some areas due to habitat loss and hunting.

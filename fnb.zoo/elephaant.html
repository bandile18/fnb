                <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                <P>Let's dive into the amazing world of elephants.

                </P>Physical Characteristics

- Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, with African elephants reaching 3m tall and weighing 4,000-7,500kg, while Asian elephants reach 2.7m tall and weigh 3,000-6,000kg.
- They have large ears, tusks made of ivory, and trunks with over 150,000 muscles and tendons, allowing them to breathe, drink, eat, smell, and communicate.
- Their trunks are highly sensitive and can pick up a blade of grass or rip branches off a tree.
- Elephants have poor eyesight but excellent hearing and smell, with a sense of smell four times that of a bloodhound.</p>

<p>Distribution

- Elephants are found in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, with African elephants inhabiting savannas and forests, and Asian elephants living in forests and grasslands.
- There are three species of elephants: African Savannah, African Forest, and Asian elephants.</p>

<p> and Nutrition

- Elephants are herbivores, eating grasses, plants, fruits, and bark, with a daily intake of 300-600 pounds of food and 160 liters of water.
- They spend 12-18 hours a day eating and can consume up to 50 tons of food per year.</p>

<p> and Social Structure

- Elephants live in matriarchal herds, led by the oldest female, with males leaving the herd around 14 years old.
- They communicate over long distances using low-frequency rumbles and can detect seismic signals through their feet.
- Elephants show empathy and grief, mourning the death of family members and even visiting old carcasses.</p>

<p> and Lifespan

- Female elephants have a 22-month gestation period, and calves weigh around 260 pounds at birth.
- Elephants can live up to 50-70 years in the wild, with the oldest known elephant living to 82 years.
- Female elephants can have babies until they're around 50 years old.</p>

<p> Status

- African elephants are listed as vulnerable, while Asian elephants are endangered due to poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict.
- Conservation efforts include protecting habitats, monitoring elephant movements, and supporting local communities to coexist with elephants ¹ ² ³.</P>
